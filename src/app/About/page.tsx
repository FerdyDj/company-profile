            Company History
          </h3>
          <p className="text-left px-8">
            Founded in 1985 by Shania Twain, Kids Company began with a simple
            vision: to create clothing that combines style, comfort, and
            durability. From the very beginning, Shania saw a gap in the market
            for kids clothing that could keep up with the energy and creativity
            of children, without compromising on quality or design. Over the
            years, Kids Company has grown into a trusted brand for parents and
            children alike, offering eco-friendly and ethically made clothing
            that reflects the vibrant spirit of childhood. With each milestone,
            we continue to expand our reach while staying true to our roots of
            quality, sustainability, and fun.
